## ✨ About

This portfolio is a simple and lightweight single-page application built with Nuxt.js. It features a dynamic showcase of my projects, along with a short introduction and ways to get in touch.

I made it to keep learning, to have something visual I can point to, and hopefully to connect with other like-minded people or future collaborators.
